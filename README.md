The client expects a “Custom Domain (bedrock.in)” certificate, but actually receives an “amazonaws.com” domain certificate, resulting in a certification error. To avoid certification error, certification verification settings must be disabled. The belows shows how to disable certificate verification.

* AWS cli : `--no-verfiy-ssl --endpoint-url "https://virginia.runtime.bedrock.in”`
* Python Boto3 : `client(verify=false, endpoint_url=https://virginia.runtime.bedrock.in)`
